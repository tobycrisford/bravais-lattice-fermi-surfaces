# Brillouin zone and fermi surface visualisation tool

Under development.

To do:

- Choose better color scheme and general page layout
- Test visualisations of higher brillouin zones
- Investigate deduping of polyhedron components again - does it speed things up enough for BZ 3 with check limit 4?
- Move approx equal checks into a common function
- Better error handling, e.g. of text in number boxes, clicking button with no inputs
- Add explanatory text plus longer physics overview underneath
- Deploy to github pages
